angular 13 & 14 is lst verion so most of is used by more people 

==> 
<html> ==> this    tag is called  root 
DOM ==> Document object model (this is going to document your html tag for more futuristic manner)
(what is input DOM ==> input element ==> input tag )


xml => its  does'nt have any pre-defined tag 
html ==> all tag is pre-defined

html ==> tag ==> element (Chrome is 

Block line element && Inline element ===>

Block line element ==> occupy entire horizontal space 

Inline Element ==> occupy necessary space only

#Different between Get and post 

post => will submit the data by appending the body , post method consist the both header and body  i.e link dont contain the details of form 

get ==> will submit the data by appending the header i.e i will get the data in the link 


lecture 11 End ===>

lecture 12  ==>


we have learned about the form 

==> in form we use onblur ==> that make input field more dynamic for the user 
==> onblur is used when user came to input field but not field the data to that input field we apply the the method

NodeJs ==> javascript Runtime Environment and also Backend FrameWork 
node 17 onward angular is accessable 

NPM ==> Node Package manager ==> Automate the build process(build tools) ==> Collecting liberies , configuratuin 


==> Nodejs vs NPM 

nodejs is a runtime Environment
npm is build process

===>build process

FolderStructure
Collecting The liberies
Compilation or Interpretation process
Configuration

+++++++++++++

package.json ==> 




package.json ==>
devDependencies is for local machine 
dependencies is use for server 

npm init ==> create the package  json

======
snipe@DESKTOP-4FNGGB3 MINGW64 /c/Angular Ashoka (master)
$ npm run test

==========

snipe@DESKTOP-4FNGGB3 MINGW64 /c/Angular Ashoka (master)
$ npm install d3 --save
==> THIS will download and save in the package.json

==========
npm install -g typescript
==> install the typescript globally

===========

npm install -g tsc

==> install tsc for typescript compiler

All Command recap ==>
1. Nodejs
2.NPM
3.npm install -g typescript
4. npm install -g tsc

lecture 14 start =====>

Disadvantage of javascript ?

1. javascript is not have type safty
2. javascript is not having scope safty

 ==> JS + typesafty ===> Typescript

==> typescript is super script of javascript
==> ts is objected oriented technique

1. Once object is create with int and in later you cannot store string value i.e typesafty

==> rollnumber : number;
==> userName : string;
==> isActive : boolean;
==> roll : 2;

     structure oriented                     vs                      object oriented 

==>  C , javascript , C squal                                         java , c++ , C# , Python                                                  
==>  code written in structre format                                 typescript   not support all oops format                                                        
==>  no concept of reuse of code                                      only support encapsulation , inheritance , abstraction and some polymorphism                                                    
==>  Debugging is very Diffcult                                                                                            
==>  it only focus only on function                                                                                             
==>                                                                                              
==>                                                                                              

 encapsulation ==>
 1. process of binding method and variable in single entity  ==>(Entity is called class)
 2. 


reference variable store object 

this . ==> Used to is called the current class object or to use  the global variable we use (this.)

class==>
1. if you want to 


Public ==>                             protected ==>                                     private ==>
1. Default Visibility                  1. inside the class                                1. Only inside the  class  
2. Inside the class                    2. inside sub-class                                2. not in the subclass
3. Outside class                       3. ont out side the class                          3. not outside class
4. In Sub-Class

Inheritance ==>

IS-A ==> Extend

HAS-A ==> called parent class object in child class

==> Create a parent and child class indiffernt file 

import {Demo} from "./demo";

==> class need to be exported before extends 

member ==> variable and method 
 ts ==> member visibality


public ==> 
1.parent  class
2.outside class
3.child class




Lecture 15 end ==>





lecture 16 ==>

constructor =>
1. constructor is created at the time object is created 
2.constructor overloading is not possible 



lecture 16 end ==>


Lecture 19 ==>

component ==> consist of view and logic 

1. view ==> view can be used in the two ways
           1. template  ==> only html code is written 
           2. templateUrl ==> we refer the external html to the project 




Lecture 19 end ==>


lecture 20 ==>


onClick()==> (Click);

id="username" ==> #username

1. if your input type 
 a.username ==> text 
 b password ==> password 

==> and you are using the click event in the angular then you need pass the value from the button to the component class
==> then function you have called has to be some parameter that parameter need to be be any then you can called the value using
==> username.value and password.value then you can get that value in the method 




lecture 20 end ==>


lecture 21==>

In this we learned about how to pass the data from parent class to the child class 

==> like one componet to another 
==> through @input filed
